<em>Part 1: Calculate the Mean, Median, Mode and Standard deviation  </em>

<em>(0.5 + 0.5 + 4 = 5) </em>




<ol>

 <li>Load the wine dataset from the given ‘wine.csv’ file into a variable (say data).</li>

 <li>From the variable, extract the numerical information into a new variable, say scores.</li>

 <li>Calculate the row-wise,column-wise, and overall mean, median, mode, and standard deviation of the dataset. In this question write separate functions for each operation and pass the variable(scores) as the parameter to the function.</li>

</ol>

<em>Part 2: Calculate the pearson correlation and covariance matrix </em>

<em>(2 + 3 = 5) </em>

<em> </em>

<ol>

 <li>Take the ‘alcohol’ and ‘Proline’ as the features from the ‘wine.csv’ dataset and calculate the pearson correlation for the same.</li>

 <li>Take any 5 features from the ‘wine.csv’ datasets and load them in a matrix. Thereafter, create the covariance matrix of the same.</li>
